working steps so far on getting audio to in wsl1/ws2, what worked for me
still work in progress, testing

Windows side
C:\pulse
Create a config.pa file in that folder with these contents:

load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-anonymous=1
load-module module-esound-protocol-tcp auth-anonymous=1
load-module module-waveout sink_name=output source_name=input record=0

WSL side, put the following in your .bashrc file:
export PULSE_SERVER=tcp:0.0.0.0
